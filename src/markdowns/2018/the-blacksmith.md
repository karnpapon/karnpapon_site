# What.

The Blacksmith is branched from The Black Codes, as merchandise and fun-and-silly-thing stuff with the first product “I (saw) Russolo”, a jigsaw with noise pattern 
inspired from white jigsaw (known as the hardest jigsaw)
this jigsaw will blur the line between the hardest and the easiest, entertainment and cumbersome, finish it or fuck it!

# Why.

I was asked to join flea market event at DE COMMUNE, a famous live-house in Bangkok with wide-range of genre performance. this is the first product came into my mind as a funny project, but i found it really encourage me to think outside of the box.

------
------

# How.
noise pattern is generated by P5.js.
the package is homemade silkscreen, thus is far from perfection.
