# What

I was commissioned to remix the song called [ "อย่างเสียใจ ( again again)" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6216p1ANpU) <br>
by [ Cadson Demak Record ](https://www.facebook.com/cadsondemakrecords/),
part of [ Cadson Demak ](https://cadsondemak.com/home/), a business to business service based in Bangkok, Thailand. 
<br>
<br>
Decided to use SuperCollider for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition <br>
to intepret an unique story, this website is part of song promo. 
Demonstrate the song structure and let audience play with composition with thier own wills.
