# Why.

when wanted to feels like participating in the festival but not to get wet.

# How.
using vedaJS as webGL.
web audio as audio processing.

------
------
# Learn.

my initial idea is to capturing audio from non-active tab and render webGL to current active tab, eg. sound from YouTube and visual from Pinterest. but afaik non-active tab can’t be captured due to security restriction, sadly currently have no workaround.

# Caveats.

audio capturing is not stop when refreshing, only stop when close the tab.

# Notes.

inspired from Amagi Takayosi’s work.
