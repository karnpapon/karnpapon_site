after graduated until back in 2016, I was working as a graphic designer, without any background or familiar with programming language before, programming came as a curious for promoting my musical project called The ███████ (pronounced as "The Black Codes").I started learning JavaScript / HTML / CSS from scratch around early 2017. 

web development is required such a steep-learning curve. Not to mention all those bundlers, builders, webpack, git, and other weird noises that adds to the overall complexitiy of learning modern web frameworks. 

learning new thing is hard, but it's challenging at the same time,like learn how to ride a bicycles.
it gives you an abilities, going far better than you thought, see more things, etc. but most important it keeps me hungry, enthusiast, and never stop to learn new things.
